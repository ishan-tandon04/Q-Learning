# Q-Learning
1. Q learning is a model that allows an algorithm to learn from an already inputed data to have the best option for the user. Typically, it does not always need to have  a model to learn from; the Q means "quality" because it is always finding the best option. It learns from past iterations of running the code to find the best solution in the end.
2. Reinforcement Learning is going through many iterations to find the most optimal way to achieve a problem (similar to game theory!). It allows computers to continuously make decisions and predict actions without human need. AI uses this a lot since it is able to learn from the situation at hand and constantly improve on it.
3. Means that it doens't always need to have a model/enviornment to learn from (see quesiton 1 answer)
4. It is uesd in medical information, as many machines can learn how to help with the diagnosis of disease. This allows machines to quickly identify what has happened to a patient. https://atm.amegroups.com/article/view/27136/html
